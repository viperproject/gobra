package ErrorReportingImport2

// this test triggers a special case within `getTypeFromCtxt` namely where typing the base of a PInvoke
// returns UnknownType as the invoked function contains a type error.
// However, this has been addressed by PR #855 that stops this package from getting type-checked in the first place
// as foo contains a type error. Thus, the only error occurring in this file is located at the import clause (as
// opposed to reporting an error for the pure function's definition or its use).

// ##(-I ./)
