  /**
    * We extend the type system of Go by introducing an additional type modifier for all types.
    * We refer to this modifier also as 'addressability modifier'.
    * The addressability modifier is either 'shared' or 'exclusive'.
    * An expression of a shared type can be aliased.
    * Such an expression can be referenced (&e) or captured by a closure.
    * Conversely, an expression of an exclusive type cannot be aliased.
    * Programs where an exclusive expression is referenced or captured are rejected by Gobra's type checker.
    *
    * As a consequence, operating on exclusive expressions does not require permissions,
    * whereas operating on shared expressions does require permissions.
    *
    * In Gobra programs, the addressability modifier is not written for types, but inferred from the context.
    * However, a variable declaration is annotated with @ to declare that the variable has a shared type,
    * e.g. 'x@ := 42; p := &x'. The modifier of a variable could be inferred, but we decided against this
    * because from our experience, then users can have problems to identify whether a variables is shared or exclusive.

  /**
    * Not all combinations of type and addressability modifier are allowed.
    * 1) For pointer types, the base type is always shared. This is over-approximation.
    * 2) For structs, the addressability of a field is the same as the addressability of the struct.
    *    This is a design decision to simplify the type system.
    * 3) Similarly, for arrays, the addressability of an index is the same as the addressability of the array.
    * 4) Slices behave the same as pointers to arrays. As such, elements of a slice are always shared.
    * 5) For maps, by definition of Go, map keys and values can not be referenced or captured. Thus they are exclusive.
    * 6) Similarly, elements of mathematical data structures are not associated with an address and thus are exclusive.
    * 7) For channels, a sent message can only be received a single time and thus the channel's element type is exclusive.
    * 8) For type definitions, the addressability modifier propagates through the type definition.
    *
    * Because of these definitions, the addressability of a nested type is determined by its outer type.
    * In our writing, we sometimes drop the addressability modifier of nested types,
    * e.g. we write 'struct{ f int }@' instead of 'struct{ f int@ }@', where @ is the shared modifier.
